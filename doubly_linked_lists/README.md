# C - Doubly Linked Lists

## Description
Implementation of doubly linked lists in C. Unlike singly linked lists, each node has pointers to both the next AND previous nodes.

## Data Structure

```c
/**
 * struct dlistint_s - doubly linked list
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous node
 * @next: points to the next node
 */
typedef struct dlistint_s
{
    int n;
    struct dlistint_s *prev;
    struct dlistint_s *next;
} dlistint_t;
